# Cassette Pirate

Read and write binary files to cassettes tapes

## Requirements

```
brew install portaudio
```

## Todo

This currently just about works, tested with a really small file. The effective bit size is massive at the moment. 1 bit is 100ms currently which means you can't really store anything sizable. But it should be possible to make the bit size much much smaller... I imagine üòÇ

Also for some reason it seems to add an empty 8 bytes at the start sometimes when converting the file back from audio to binary. Not sure why it does this so need to figure that out too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Figured out that sometimes when listening it gets the wrong bit, or more often it gets a number of wrong bits which shifts all the values and ultimatley fucks everything up
I think a possible solution is to add an audible delimetter at the start of the recording? The other possibility is the listen to the recording multiple times and patch the broken bits
